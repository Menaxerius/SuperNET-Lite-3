Store and use your coins easily. The Wallet is a nodejs based Wallet, coming with executable for Windows, Linux and Mac. Every device that runs nodejs can start the application with \"nodejs ./server.js\".\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nSuperNET-Lite connects to public nodes in the Nxt Network. Due to the leightweight nature of Nxt and the service to allow Assets and other Blockchain services, we can expand on the rich server structure of Nxt. The MultiGateWay is a decentralized Exchange, allowing to store coins in a distributed database and control them with your Nxt account in the SuperNET Lite Wallet. Furthermore, you can use the whole Nxt client with your account, investing in any Asset on the Nxt Blockchain.\r\n\r\n### SuperNET Features\r\nSuperNET will provide more features than the MultiGateWay, which is currently a distributed multi-wallet. Please stay tuned.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@superNETOrg @vanBreuk @supereth @sigwo\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
