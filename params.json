You can use Nxt, Bitcoin, Litecoin, DASH, Dogecoin and other currencies with your wallet. You can store and use your coins easily. The Wallet is a nodejs based Wallet, coming with executable for Windows, Linux and Mac. Every device that runs nodejs can start the application with \"nodejs ./server.js\".\r\n\r\n![SuperNET Login](https://github.com/Tosch110/SuperNET-Lite-3/blob/master/img/snet_lockscreen.png)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nSuperNET-Lite connects to public nodes in the Nxt Network. Due to the lightweight nature of Nxt and the service to allow Assets and other Blockchain services, we can expand on the rich server structure of Nxt. The MultiGateWay service allows to store coins in distributed multi-signature accounts, and delivers equivalent coin tokens that can be used from your Nxt account in the SuperNET Lite Wallet. Furthermore, you can use the complete Nxt client with your account, investing in any Asset on the Nxt Blockchain.\r\n\r\n![Coins Overview](https://github.com/Tosch110/SuperNET-Lite-3/blob/master/img/coins.png)\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\nSuperNET-Lite is based on html, javascript and nodejs. The Nxt NRS framework and Jay provide a javascript wrapper which creates and signs every transaction that is made within the wallet. This signed transaction will be sent to a public node of the Nxt network. Your password never leaves your computer. Accounts are stored local in the Browser. When using incognito mode, nothing will be saved. \r\nWhen a local Nxt instance is running, SuperNET-Lite will use this instead of any public node. \r\nPublic nodes are chosen from the websites peerexplorer.com and nxtpeers.com. Both provide a trusted service to scan the Nxt nodes and display most updated, reliable and secure (hallmarked) Nxt nodes. The framework developed by @jonesnxt and @tosch110 then tests various nodes for time hashes and speed to find the best node for you to use.\r\n\r\n![Nxt Wallet](https://github.com/Tosch110/SuperNET-Lite-3/blob/master/img/nxt_wallet.png)\r\n\r\n### SuperNET Features\r\nSuperNET will provide more features than the MultiGateWay, which is currently a distributed multi-wallet. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@tosch110 @jonesnxt @superNETOrg @vanBreuk @supereth @sigwo\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nhttp://multigateway.org/\r\nhttps://nxt.org\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
